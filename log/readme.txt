The MD5-hash of the admin-password must be saved
in the file "config.php" in the root directory of Part-DB.

To get the MD5-hash of a string, you can use the debug site.
Just type in your desired password and try to enable the debug log,
then the MD5-hash of the tested password will be displayed.
Now you can copy this MD5-hash into the file "config.php".
